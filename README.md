The foundation of great marketing is an up-to-date audience of contacts, including important data like who has interacted with your online store and when they subscribed to your emails. Mailchimp offers powerful and flexible tools that help you manage this information and use it to create targeted campaigns.

We'll cover a few basics about your audience in this article, including what you need to know before you start importing contacts into Mailchimp.

Things to consider
How you build and manage your audience affects the ways you can use Mailchimp. With the right data and organization, you can segment contacts based on a variety of criteria and send certain content to target groups. Take a moment to think about your marketing goals, who your contacts are, and what information is relevant to them.

## **Types of contacts**
Your Mailchimp audience is designed to help you collect and manage subscribed, non-subscribed, and unsubscribed contacts.

Here are some definitions for each.

Subscribed contact
Someone who has opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns.
Unsubscribed contact
Someone who was opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns, but isn't currently.
Non-subscribed contact
Someone who has interacted with your online store, but hasn't opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns.

## **Create an audience**
When you create a Mailchimp account, we'll ask you for some information to comply with anti-spam practices and help you track performance. Weâ€™ll use this information to get your audience started. All you have to do next is add or collect some contacts.

You can add subscribed contacts one-by-one or multiple, upload contacts from a file, copy and paste contacts from a spreadsheet, or use an integration to sync your contacts. We prohibit users from sending to purchased, rented, or third-party lists, so be sure to check our audience requirements before you begin.

### **How to add a subscribed contact**
**To add a single subscribed contact to an audience, follow these steps.**

If the email address is already on your audience and you want to update the information you have on file, check the If this person is already in my audience, update their profile box.

After the person has been successfully added, we'll display a success message at the top of the page.

### **How to import multiple subscriber**

The file import process has two parts: First, you'll prepare your spreadsheet of contacts outside of Mailchimp and save it as a CSV file. Next, you'll use our import tool to upload your file and add your contacts to your Mailchimp audience.

**To prepare your file for import, follow these steps.**

1. In a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets, open your blank worksheet.
2. Create and label a column for **Email Address**. This is the only field we require.

4. Paste your contacts' information into the relevant fields in the spreadsheet.
